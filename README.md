# React Notes
- React Elements are equivalent to DOM elements and it is a object and when we render it, this becomes a HTMLELEMENT
- JSX is not a part of react , it is not HTML in JS , It is HTML like syntax in JS 
-  JSX is traspilled by parcel which in turn uses BABEL to compile JSX into React create Elements and then it converts to JS Object after which it gets rendered and becomes HTML element.
- In JSX tags attributes are written in Camel Case  

# React Components

- There 2 types of component class (old way) based and functional (New way) components
- React functional component is just a javascript function. A function which is returning a JSX is a functional cpmponent.
